## Food, Diet and Digestion

Eating is the most efficient way to consume enough energy to pump oxygen into the body, repair tissue, and to be able to move. The foods we eat are divided into seven groups:

- Carbohydrates
- Fats
- Proteins
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Fibre
- Water (debate about whether water is a food group)

  
 When a person consumes less food than the amount of energy the body is consuming, it is called starvation. When a person consumes the correct quantity of total food but not enough of certain FGs, it is called malnutrition.
 
### Food groups
|FG|Includes|Sources|Function|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Carbohydrates (contains Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen)**|	Simple carbohydrates: Glucose and Lactose |	Biscuits and jam	| Provides energy |
|**Carbohydrates (contains Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen)**|	Complex carbohydrates: Glycogen, starch, cellulose|	Pasta, rice, potatoes, and bread	|Energy storage|
|**Fats (contains Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen)**|	Animal Fats|	Meat, dairy|	Insulation, protections of organs, energy storage
|**Fats (contains Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen)**|	Plant fats	|Plant oils	| Insulation, protections of organs, energy storage |
|**Proteins (contains Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen)**|	Animal proteins|	Eggs, meat, fish	|Growth + tissue repair|
|**Proteins (contains Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen)**|	Plant proteins|	Nuts, pulses	| Growth + tissue repair|
|**Mineral/Food group**|**Sources**|**Provides**|**Deficiency**|
|**Vitamin C**|Fresh veg	|Healthy skin + bones	|Scurvy|
|**Vitamin D**	|Fish oil|	Regulates calcium for bones and teeth	|Rickets|
|**Mineral: Calcium**	|Dairy	|Strong bones	|Poor development of bones and teeth|
|**Mineral: Iron**|	Liver, red meat|	Haemoglobin in red blood cells|	Anaemia|
|**Fibre**	|Skin of veg + fruit	|Prevents constipation	|Constipation|
|**Water**|	Food and drink we ingest 	|Regulate body temperature, excretion|	Dehydration|

 Food tests are used to identify a food sample. It is usually prepared by breaking down the food and adding water to turn it into a solution.

#### Tests
##### Testing for Simple Carbohydrates (sugar)
- Take the solution and put it in a boiling tube
- Add 2cm3 of Benedict’s solution to the testing solution and heat it in a water bath
- If it changes from blue to brick red, sugar is present.

*Blue* _(No sugar present) → *Green* _(Traces of sugar) → *Orange* _Moderate → *Brick red* _(Large amounts of sugar)
##### Testing for Complex Carbohydrates (starch)
- Put some starch solution into a test tube
- Add a few drops of Iodine
- If it changes from brown to black, starch is present
 
##### Testing for Protein
- Add some protein solution into a test tube
- Add 2cm3 of sodium hydroxide to the solution
- Then add 2cm3 of copper sulphate and shake
- This solution is named the Biuret solution
- If the solution changes from blue to purple, then protein is present


##### Testing for Fats
- Add 2cm3 of ethanol to a test tube with a solution and shake
- Add 2cm3 of water and shake again
- If fat is present, it changes into a cloudy emission    
  
#### Elements in each FG:
|Substance| Carbon	|Hydrogen	|Oxygen|	Nitrogen|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carbohydrates	|Yes|Yes|Yes|-|	
|Protein	|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Fat |Yes|Yes|Yes|-|

##### Testing for Vitamin C
DCPIP is a dark blue liquid which turns colourless when given enough vitamin C. Method:

- Measure 1cm3 of DCPIP into a test tube
- Count the drops of vitamin C added and shake the tube until it becomes colourless using a clean dropper
  
The fewer drops of the substance required to decolourise the DCPIP, the more vitamin C it contains. Lower vitamin C content can come from the time kept or if it’s been heated/boiled.

**Independent variable – Type of substance**

**Dependent variable – Drops of juice**

**Control variable – DCPIP**

### Energy consumption
Uses:
- To produce heat
- To create movement
- To help growth
- Reproduction

Energy can be measured in a couple of ways; Joules ($J$), Kilojoules ($kJ$) ($1000 J$ = $1 kJ$) and Kilocalories and calories ($kcal$, $cal$) ($1 kcal$ = $1000 cal$)

Energy requirements rely on three things:
- Age
- Gender
- Activity
  
Young children and teenagers are rapidly creating new cells, requiring more energy. Older people have a slower metabolism. This means the rate they release energy from their food is lower. This means older people need less energy. On average, males require more energy due to generally having a larger body with more muscle.
A physically active person requires more energy. A builder would require more energy than an office worker.

Pregnant women have high energy and protein needs, due to the high rate of growth of the developing foetus. They require more calcium and more iron and breastfeeders need extra protein to make milk.

Extra energy is from meals consisting of lots of carbohydrates. If a person consumes more energy than they use, they are usually overweight. This causes an increase in disease and strokes.

### Weight and Height
Comparing a person's height to their weights can determine whether they need to lose, maintain or gain weight, however, this only works for people above 18. 

#### BMI (Body Mass Index)
BMI is a measure of whether someone is the correct weight for their height. It can be calculated like this:

BMI =  $weight/height^2 $

> Weight is always measured in $kg$ and height in $m$.
		
##### BMI value	Description
|Value|Description|
|:-:|:-|
|< 18.5	|Underweight|
|18.5 – 24.9|	Normal|
|25 – 29.9|	Overweight|
|30 <	|Obese|

Athletes have high BMIs but are not overweight. They have a higher proportion of muscle, which is heavier than fat.  

### Digestion
#### The Digestive system

##### Ingestion
- Put food in mouth
- Broken down for a larger surface area
##### Digestion
- To break food into small soluble pieces
- Digestion cannot occur without enzymes
##### Absorption
- Small intestine, nutrients enter blood
#####  Assimilation
- Releasing energy from the nutrients
##### Egestion
- Releasing yummy faeces

##### Enzymes                  
	Enzymes are proteins which act like biological catalysts. They can be used many times and the molecule it acts on is called a substrate. Enzymes are substrate specific. This means that to break down starch and lipids, you need 2 different enzymes. The correct structure must have a tight fit with the active site, to enable the catalysation. Amylase can only break down carbohydrates and Lipase lipids. The enzyme is not used up. 
		
|Enzyme|	Substrate|	Product|
|Carbohydrase|	Carbohydrate|	Glucose|
|Amylase	|Starch|	Glucose|
|Protease	|Protein	|Amino acids|
|Lipase	|Fats (Lipids)|	Glycerol and fatty acids|

###### Amylase
- Breaks down carbohydrates into glucose
- It is produced in the salivary glands in the mouth and the pancreas
- It breaks down starch in bot the mouth and the small intestine
###### Protease
- Breaks down proteins into small amino acids
- It breaks down protein in the stomach and the small intestine
###### Lipase
- Breaks down lipids in to glycerol and fatty acids
- Digestion of fat occurs in the small intestine.
