# Geography Year 9 Topic 1 - 3



## Topic 1 - Coasts

___
<br>
A coast is the zone between land and sea which can be an area or a line. 

### Uses of a coast


Coastlines are important because:

**1.	Residency**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Water is an important part of life. Easy access to water usually meant that more of the population would be there.

**2. Fishing**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	This gives straight-forward access to food.

**3.	Trading**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Trading becomes a lot easier with access to the ocean from the lack of obstacles.

**4.	Tourism**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Beaches are popular in the tourism industry.

**5.	Agriculture**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Simple access to water also means it is easier to take care of animals.

**6.	Wildlife**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Like agriculture and residency, being in a close vicinity to water helps to survive.

<br>

### The wind
Wind drastically changes the shape of the coast. Waves are created by wind blowing over the surface of the sea/ocean. The size of a wave depends on:
-	Length of blowing
-	Strength
-	Distance of blowing (fetch)
Only when all three factors occur together large waves are produced. 


![Wave diagram](https://i0.wp.com/thescienceandmathszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0564.jpg?fit=2052%2C887&ssl=1)

*Wave height* – Trough to Crest in height.
*Wavelength* – Length between crests
*Crest* – highest point
*Trough* - lowest point

When a wave breaks, the water that runs up the beach is known as the **swash**, and the water that runs down is called the **backwash**. 

When the backwash is stronger, sand is eroded from the beach and when the swash is stronger, sand is deposited onto the beach.

### Landform Creation
There are three things that are required to create new landforms. (Deposition is not shown because, well, the water loses energy and puts the rock/load down.)
#### Erosion
There are four main ways in which water can erode the coastline:

1.	Hydraulic action
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Water is forced into cracks; air compresses and the cracks widen.

2. 	Abrasion
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Pebbles transported by waves act like sandpaper causing it to breakdown.

3. 	Attritiom
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Rock transported in water collide and break into small fragments. This makes rocks smaller and rounder.

4.	Solution

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Weak acids in salt water create chemical reactions which dissolve and erode rock such as limestone and chalk.

The larger the rock, the more energy it takes to transport it (Anything above 2mm in size is considered gravel). 

#### Transportation

There are four main ways in which things can be transported:
1.	Traction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Where pebbles and large material are rolled along the seabed.
2.	Saltation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Where small pieces of shingle or large sand grains are bounced along the seabed.
3.	Suspension
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Small particles are suspended in the flow of the water
4.	Solution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	When minerals in rock are dissolved in seawater and carried in solution. It is not visible.

### Longshore Drift

If the waves break at an angle compared to the shoreline, material can move along the beach.  This process is called longshore drift. The swash moves the sand up the beach and the backwash usually brings the sand straight down.

### Erosional landforms
#### Headlands and bays
If a coastline is made of sections of harder and softer rock, these will erode at different speeds when hit by waves. The soft rocks erodes quick and forms a bay, while the hard rock will erode slower and form a headland.
#### Cliffs
Cliffs can form when high land meets the sea.  The bottom is constantly hit and ends up collapsing on top of itself. The rock that hasn’t eroded is called the overhang and the rock surface at the bottom is called the wave-cut notch. When the overhang collapses it creates a wave-cut platform, which is the rock resting on the seabed.
#### Caves, Arches, Stacks, Stumps
1.	Caves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Caves are when weak areas in a headland are hit by waves and are forced opened. This uses hydraulic action.
2.	Arches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	An arch is formed when a cave is widened and deepened and reaches both sides of the headland.
3.	Stacks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	A stack is formed when an arch is continually undercut and eventually leaving an isolated stack.
4.	Stumps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	A stump is created when a stack eventually erodes down to just above sea level leaving a stump.

## Topic 2 - Population

___
<br>

### Census'

Governments have been recording population for a long time! Soon after a birth, it would be registered in a birth certificate. This can be useful to the government for:
-	Hospital
-	Schools
-	Housing
Other major milestones which are officially recorded are:
-	Marriage
-	Death
To get more detailed information, every 10 years people carry out a census. 

### Population Change

Human populations grow when there are more babies born than those who die.

#### Natural Change

To calculate the natural population growth, we need to figure out the birth and death rate.                                                         
Birth rate: Babies born per thousand people
Death rate: Deaths per thousand people
A natural increase occurs when the birth rate is larger than the death rate. A natural change occurs when the rates are equal and a natural decrease occurs when the death rate overpowers the birth rate.

##### Reasons for Natural Change

When a country is very poor and undeveloped the birth rate will be high because:
 
	Religion prohibits the use of contraceptives
	Tradition visualises having many children as wealth
	Children might be needed for labour
	Girls marry early
	Women have little involvement in family planning
 
The death rate could also be high because:
 
	Diseases
	War
	Famine/Severe droughts
	Lack of clean water
	Poor hygiene
	Poor hospitals and clinics
	Natural disasters
	Limited education
 


As the country develops, many factors dissipates through its advancements. Women in richer and more developed tend to have fewer children because:
 
	Economic development
	Access to contraception
	Improved education
	Anxiety over future
	Parenting less attractive
	Costs of bringing children up
	Change in social attitudes
 

National situations are not the only heading of factors for population, but also where you are living in. Population density describes how crowded a place is. It is usually measured in people/km2. You could also describe the density as densely or sparsely populated.

$popdensity = totpop / area$

Population distribution describes how evenly spread the people inhabiting an area are. The geographical location can also affect the immigration into the nation. Most of the earth is inhabitable for humans and prevents them from living there for several reasons...

    70% Water
    6%   Desert
    6%   Too cold
    5%   Mountains
    5%   Forest
    5%   Cannot grow food
    *3%   Habitable for humans*

#### Migration

Migration is the movement of people from one area to another. An emigrant is a person who leaves a country from another while an immigrant is a person who enters the country from another. The reasons for [emi/immi]grating are categorised as push and pull factors:
 
**Push:**
-	Jobs
-	War
-	Famine
-	Natural Disasters
-	Long travelling distances
-	 Lack of education
-	Poor economy

**Pull:**
-	Better healthcare
-	Jobs
-	Religion
-	Education
-	Strong economy
-	Many jobs
-	Better climate
-	Reliable food supply
-	Family members
 
There can also be barriers to migration:
 
-	Need for documentation
-	Migration rules
-	Long application processes for visas + work permits
-	Proving skills
-	Religion
-	Lack of money
-	Language
-	Work permits 

Reasons why it is also a good thing
 
-	Increased economic growth
-	More flexible labour markets
-	Fills job vacancies in unpopular jobs
-	Provides skilled workers
-	Working age migrants provide net benefit to government budget
-	A solution to an ageing population
-	Greater cultural diversity

#### Population surge

Some countries are much more wasteful than others. For example, the USA would require 5 earths resources if the entire human population lived like the USA.
Energy is a big thing in society. There are two forms of energy production, non-renewable and renewable.
**Non-renewable:**
 
-	Natural gas is used to produce energy and heating
-	Oil is used for heating, lighting, transport and energy
-	Wood is often the only source of energy in poor countries
-	Coal is used for heating and to produce energy
-	Nuclear energy uses a mineral called uranium to produce electricity
 
Coal, oil and gas are known as fossil fuels. This is because they were formed millions of years ago and are being used up faster than can be replaced. There are two problems with our reliance on fossil fuels:
**1.	They are running out**
Oil and gas will run out in about 52 years, while coal will run out in 114. They will not last long if we continue to greatly use them.
**2.	Burning them releases Carbon Dioxide**
When fossil fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It’s called a greenhouse gas because as it builds up in the atmosphere, it traps more of the heat that would have escaped. This means the more carbon dioxide there is in the air the warmer the climate.

**Alternatives and renewable energy:**
-	Waves create energy by the wind blowing on the sea
-	Wind can rotate windmills to produce energy
-	Tidal energy can be produced where fast blowing water enters estuaries
-	Solar energy comes from the sun
-	Water, if fast and continuous, produces hydro electricity

### Heat Pumps

Heating a home uses a lot of fossil fuels, one new technology found is heat pumps. What they do is concentrate the heat they take outside and sends it to your house. It takes a lot of energy. Using renewable sources makes this a very sustainable method of providing hot water

## Topic 3 - Weather and Climate

**Weather** - The day to day condition of the air around us (atmosphere)
**Climate** - The average weather conditions calculate over about >30 years

The weather can play positive and negative on people:

**Good:**
- Vitamin C & D can improve health
- Rain and warmth can help agriculture
- Wind can help move boats
- Storms can create work for construction workers and other departments
- Sales of barbecues, cold drinks and ice cream increase in hot weather
- Sunny weather can increase tourism
- Sunshine can produce solar power
- Good weather can improve mood

**Bad:**
- Sunshine can cause sunburn and heartache
- Too [little/much] rain can ruin crops
- Ice can cause vehicles to lose traction
- Rain can delay construction and other physical work
- Storms can create a barrier to shopping
- Bad weather can impact tourism
- Lack of sunshine can impact energy production
- Water can freeze with bad conditions
- Bad weather can (somehow?) worsen mentality

Some people suffer from a condition named S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder). The long, cold and wet summers can give a negative mood.

### Measuring the Weather

#### Temperature

- Means how hot/cold it is
- Measured by a [max/min] thermometer
- Measured in degrees centigrade

#### Wind speed

- Means how fast the wind is blowing
- Measured by an anemometer
- The faster the cups turn, the faster the wind is blowing
- Measured in kph
- Can also be measured using the Beaufort scale

#### Wind direction

- Means which direction the wind is blowing
- Measured by a weathervane
- The arrow points in the compass direction the wind is coming from
- Can be recorded on a wind rose with enough information

#### Precipitation

- Means the water that falls from the sky
- Can be measured by a wind gauge, which is a metal cylinder sunk part way into the ground
- The funnel catches the rain and is emptied into a measuring cylinder
- Measured in millimetres

#### Sunshine Hours

- Means the number of hours of sunshine that have been in a day
- Measured by a Campbell Stokes Sunshine Recorder
- The glass sphere concentrates the rays of the Sun onto a card which is scorched by the Sun
- Measured in hours

#### Visibility

- Means how far ahead we can see
- Measured by a visility meter
- Measured in metres or kilometres

#### Cloud Cover

- Means how much of the sky is covered by clouds
- Recorded using oktas
- Oktas show the sky in eights
- Calculated through observation or satellite image

### Cloud types

- Cirrus are white delicate and feathery clouds found at high altitudes
- Stratus are low-level clous that are blanket-like with a uniform [grey/white] colour
- Cumulus are puffy clouds that look like floating cotton
- Cumulonimbus are very tall dark clouds seen during a thunderstorm

### How to read a climate graph

- Temperature shown as a line graph
- Rainfall shown as a bar graph

### Factors which can affect climate

#### 1. Latitude

The closer you get to the Equator, the warmer it tends to get.

> Sunshine loses a lot of energy as it travels through the atmosphere. The more it moves through, the more it loses
> > Kenya is closer to the sun than Iceland which means the rays move less and therefore lose less energy. It is also because of its small area of sunshine. This means the rays are less spread out.

#### 2. Altitude

The height a which a place is above sea level is it's altitude. **The higher the altitude, the colder it is.**

> Most of the sunlight  passes through the atmosphere without heating it up, however it heats the surface up. The warm land and sea heats up the air around.

On average air temp. drops by $1$ degree for every 100m gained in altitude.

#### 3. Distance from the sea

Oceans change temp. much slower than land. This means coastal areas tend to be colder in summers and warmer in winters. This doesnt apply to inland, however large lakes can also act like the sea.

#### 4. Ocean currents

Some currents are warm and others are cold. If a country lies beside a cold current like the Antarctic Circumplex current, it tends to have a cooler climate. Those beside warm currents like the North Atlantic Gyre current will have warmer temperatures. If the North Atlantic current wasn't near the British Isles, the winter temperature would have dropped by 4 degrees.

#### 5. Prevailing winds

The most common direction for the wind to come from at a place is called the prevailing wind. In the British Isles, our prevailing wind comes from the South West. This wind can show the [warmth/cold] and [dry/wet] weather of the region.

The UK is generally quite wet. Using our knowledge of the prevailing wind you can observe that the wind that travels over the sea picks up the water it pass over (about $0.0000001-0.000001mm$ a day!)

### Air Masses

Even then, most winds dont come from the prevailing wind direction! This is because theres a cold air mass sitting over Eastern Europe.

An air mass is a large volume of air which travels from one area to another.

The weather an airmass brings is determined by the region and the surface it moves over.


| Name | Source Area | Weather characteristics |
| :------ | :------ | :-----: |
| Tropical Maritime | Atlantic Ocean | warm & wet |
| Tropical Continental | Southern Europe, North Africa | warm & dry |
| Polar Maritime | North Atlantic | cold & wet |
| Polar Continental | Northern Europe | cold & dry |
| Arctic Maritime | Arctic Ocean | cold & wet |

The most affecting weather in the UK is the polar maritime.

### CASE STUDY - Storm Emma, British Isles, Feb-28 - Mar-02 2018

**Primary Effects - Impacts caused directly by the storm**
- 15cm - 20cm of snow over the course of 3 days
- Storm Emma goes over 70mph
- Hundreds are stranded for 36 hours (1.5 days)

**Secondary Effects - Impacts caused after the storm**
- Gas deficit warning
- Trains were stranded overnight

**Responses - Help effective immediately during the storm**
- Greggs' delivery driver hands cakes to stranded people
- Taxis offer to shop and retrieve medicine for the elderly
- Red Cross issues blankets and pillows to homeless people

### How to write an answer comparing two different climates

#### Data
|Month|Max temp.|Min temp.|Days of air frost|Sunshine hours|Rainfall|Days of rainfall >= 1mm|
|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Lisburn weather station|12.64|5.91|33.09|1345.24|917.41|156.99|
|UK Ann. [Tot./Avg.]|12.4|5.3|54.6|1372.8|1154|156.2|

#### Answer
**Try and include all elements of the data when writing your answer:**

"*Firstly, Lisburn has a negligible difference of 0.24°C when it comes to the minimum temperature and 0.61°C with the maximum. Lisburn has considerably less days of air frost, about 21.51 days. The largest difference is the amount of rainfall. Lisburn has about 917.41mm of rainfall, while the UK has 1154mm. The difference for sunshine hours and days of rainfall is also  somewhat negligible, 27.56 hours less of sunshine and .79 more days of rainfall.*"

When it comes to most describing questions, **use data and include as many numbers as possible (where it adds to the info required)**
