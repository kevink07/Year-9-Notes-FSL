## Protein - yay!
Protein is an important macronutrient. The building blocks that make up protein are called **amino acids**. Each protein is made up of a unique combination of these.
Functions:
- Growth and Repair of body tissues, muscles and bloodcells.
- Maintenance of the body.
- Energy (secondary source).

  **Animal Sources**
  - Meat & Poultry
  - Fish
  - Eggs
  - Milk & dairy products.
  
  **Vegetable Sources**
  - Pulses-(peas, beans & lentils)
  - Rice
  - Cereals
  - Nuts
  - Seeds
  
  **Why are people eating less animal protein?**
  - Increasin number of people are turning vegetarian.
  - Animal foods are more expensive than plant foods.
  - Animal foods have high fat amounts.
  - Animal foods have saturated fat which was linked to colinary heart disease.
  - Food scares e.g. BSE scare, Salmonella concerns, etc.
  
  **Alternative protein foods**
  - Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) (made from soya beans)
  - Quorn (a miscoprotein which is related to the mushroom)
  - Tivall (made from wheat & vegetable protein)
  - Tofu & Bean Curd (made from soya beans)
  
  **Protein Complementation**
  Protein sources are classified as **high or low biological value** depeding on whether they have all amino acids required by the body (indispensable amino acids).
  **HBV sources**
  - Chicken
  - Beef
  - Pork
  - Eggs
  - Milk
  - Cheese
  - Yoghurt
  - Soya beans
  - Quinoa
  
  **LBV sources**
  - Beans
  - Peas
  - Nuts
  - Lentils (Pulses)
  - Seeds
  
  **What is the problem with vegetable (plant) sources of protein?**
    Plant sources of protein do not contain sufficient levels of one or more of the indespensable amino acids required by humans.
    We can overcome this problem by taking a mixture of proteins from plant foods together. THey compliment each other by supplying the full range of essential amino acids needed by humans.
    Examples:
  - Beans on toast
  - Spicy bean soup and wheaten
  
  An example of a one-day meal plan which contains protein-rich foods:

   Breakfast: Bread


   Snack: Breadstickes

   Lunch: White Bread

   Snack: Bread Bites

   Dinner: Freshly Baked Brown Bread

   Dessert: Banana Bread

### Fat ###
Although we often consider fats as bad for our health, they're not all bad!

In fact, they have some important jobs to do in our bodies.

**Functions of fat**

  - It supplies us with energy
  - It helps insolate the body and keeps us warm.
  - It protects the major organs e.g. the heart and the kidneys
  - Makes all body cells
  - It provides us with the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E & K
  - It provides essential fatty acids

**Types of fat - key differences**

**Saturate**

Mainly solid at room temperature and from animal sources

**Unsaturated**

Mainly liquid at room temperature and from plant sources e.g. vegetable oils.

**Foods high in saturated fat**

  - Cheese
  - Butter
  - Lard
  - Fat on meat e.g. bacon, steak
  - Burgers, sausages etc

**Foods high in unsaturated fat**
  - Oily fish (e.g. salmon or mackeral)
  - Olive oil/sunflower oil
  - Avocados

**Suitable Substitutes to cut down on saturated fat**

 1. Butter -> Low-fat spread, margerine, olive/sunflower oil

 2. Full-fat milk -> Semi-skimmed, soya, almond, 1% and vegetable-based milk

 3. Full-fat yoghurt -> low-fat/fat-free yoghurt

 4. Cheddar cheese -> edam, feta, ricotta, cottage and reduced fat cheddar

 5. Red/processed meat e.g. mince, burgers, sausages, ham, bacon -> turkey, fish, reduced-fat mince/linear cuts of meat

**Examples of Visible Fats**

- Oils
- Rind on steak or bacon
- Butter
- Margerine
- Lard

**Examples of Invisible Fats**

- Biscuits
- Buns
- Cakes
- Cheese
