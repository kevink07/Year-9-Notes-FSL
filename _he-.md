## Protein
Protein is an important macronutrient. The building blocks that make up protein are called **amino acids**. Each protein is made up of a unique combination of these.

**Functions:**
- Growth and Repair of body tissues, muscles and bloodcells.
- Maintenance of the body.
- Energy (secondary source).

**Animal Sources**
- Meat & Poultry
- Fish
- Eggs
- Milk & dairy products.
  
**Vegetable Sources**
- Pulses - (peas, beans & lentils)
- Rice
- Cereals
- Nuts
- Seeds

  
### Why are people eating less animal protein?
- Increasing number of people are turning vegetarian.
- Animal foods are more expensive than plant foods.
- Animal foods have high fat amounts
- Animal foods have saturated fat which was linked to colinary heart disease.
- Food scares e.g. BSE scare, Salmonella concerns, etc.
    
### Alternative protein foods
- Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) (made from soya beans)
- Quorn (a miscoprotein which is related to the mushroom)
- Tivall (made from wheat & vegetable protein)
- Tofu & Bean Curd (made from soya beans)

### Protein Complementation
  Protein sources are classified as **high or low biological value** depeding on whether they have all amino acids required by the body (indispensable amino acids).

**HBV sources**
- Chicken
- Beef
- Pork
- Eggs
- Milk
- Cheese
- Yoghurt
- Soya beans
- Quinoa

**LBV sources**
- Beans
- Peas
- Nuts
- Lentils (Pulses)
- Seeds

  
**What is the problem with vegetable (plant) sources of protein?**
Plant sources of protein do not contain sufficient levels of one or more of the indespensable amino acids required by humans.
We can overcome this problem by taking a mixture of proteins from plant foods together. They compliment each other by supplying the full range of essential amino acids needed by humans. **Examples:**

- Beans on toast
- Spicy bean soup and wheaten

An example of a one-day meal plan which contains protein-rich foods:

Breakfast: Bread

Snack: Breadsticks

Lunch: White Bread

Snack: Bread Bites

Dinner: Freshly Baked Brown Bread

Dessert: Banana Bread
