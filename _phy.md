# Physics Year 9 Topic 1 - 2

## Topic 1 - Forces

All forces are either a push or pull which acts on an object ( due to an interaction with another). Force can be measured in Newtons ($N$) with a Newton meter. **Effects:**

- A force can cause an object to [accelerate/decelerate]
- A force can cause an object to change direction
- A force can cause an object to change its shape

### Some Examples of Forces

#### Reaction forces

All forces occur in pairs and a 'reaction' force is a general term used to describe a force which acts opposite to an action force. 

#### Weight + mass

Standing on the road, your mass would cause 2 forces, the weight and the reaction. The weight is pulling you down and the reaction is pushing you up at the same strength as the weight.

#### [Air resistance/Drag]

```Weight > Drag``` - [Acceleration (towards the ground) / Deceleration (towards the sky)]

```Weight = Drag``` - Constant speed

```Weight < Drag``` - [Deceleration (towards the ground) / Acceleration (towards the sky)]

#### Magnets

``` North - South ``` - Magnetic Attraction
``` North - North ``` - Magnetic Repulsion
``` South - North ``` - Magnetic Attraction
``` South - South ``` - Magnetic Repulsion

#### Electrostatics

``` Positive - Negative ``` - Electrostatic attraction
``` Positive - Positive ``` - Electrostatic repulsion

In particle terms:

``` Proton - Electron ``` - Electrostatic attraction
``` Proton - Proton ``` - Electrostatic repulsion

#### Buoyancy

In water, the amount of water you displace affects the force of your buoyancy.

### Unbalanced forces

When adding forces, you must take into account their direction as well!

### Gravity
