## Slavery and Moses

### Transatlantic slave trade

The transatlantic slave trade was the forced enslavement of people from Africa to the Americas in the 1500s. The first English traders of enslaved people was Sir John Hawking and Sir Francis Drake.

### Triangular trade & Chattel Slavery

The triangular trade was a system of transatlantic trade in the 16th century between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. It mainly consisted of selling European products to Africa for slaves, which were then brought to America and sold. Chattel slavery is when enslaved people legally become the property of their owners and any children born to the enslaved were automatically enslaved too.

### People of benefit from the Slave Trade

- British Enslavers profited from the buying and selling of enslaves Africans to work on plantation. British ships transported 3.4 million people from Africa, only 2.6 million survived.
-	Plantation Owners bought enslaved people to work on their land for free. They were able to make huge profits and used it to obtain political power and invest in factories.
-	Factory Owners built their factories using profit made from the slave trade. The availability of cheap cotton grew Britain’s textile industry significantly, contributing to the industrial revolution. This also provided many jobs.
-	West African leaders were active participants, capturing and selling people to Europeans. Some tribes also supplied gold in exchange for firearms, to expand territory.

### Forms of resistance

- **Resistance at work** - Some people showed their resistance by breaking tools and working slowly.
- **Attempting freedom** - Some enslaved people risked running away. This was made harder by being branded and having notices in newspapers offering rewards for bringing them back.
- **Families and communities** - Many enslaved communities were developed and created family units despite the threat of being broken up by plantation owners.
- **Religion** - Continued practice of West African beliefs after being banned. Enslaves people were also forced the beliefs of the plantation owner and brought to church services which preached about obeying orders.
- **Language** - Enslaved people maintained their culture and languages despite the constant attempts to reduce ties to their homelands. In Jamaica, many spoke Kromanti. Despite many language barriers, many created a universal body language and mixtures of African, broken English and broken Spanish.
- **Music** - Traditional African instruments were also recreated and dances which involved clapping and rhythmic drumming.
- **Markets** - The market was important because it was an opportunity to sell produce, make money, socialise and free people, share information and have some leisure time. Many rebellions were linked to white officials trying to clamp down or influence market days.

### Abolitionists

Despite slavery being normalised, some were abolitionists – someone who wants slavery to end. A common example of this is William Wilberforce. 

### Modern Slavery

Modern slavery is when an individual is exploited by others for personal or commercial gain whether tricked, coerced or forced they lose their freedom. There are seven types of modern slavery:

-	Human trafficking – Use of threats to recruit for exploitation
-	Forced Labour – Any forced work with threat of punishment
-	Debt bondage/Bonded labour – Forced to pay off debts (from a loan)
-	Descent-based slavery – Born into slavery
-	Child slavery – Exploitation of minors
-	Forced + Early marriages – Marriage against will
-	Domestic Servitude – Works in a house, vulnerable to abuse

Vulnerability from poverty and exclusion makes up the majority of reasons for enslavement today. Signs to look out for are:


-	Reluctant to interact and appears to be under control of someone else
-	Has few belongings and wears same/unsuitable clothes
-	Not able to move freely, no access to personal identity
-	Reluctant to talk with officials or strangers
-	Appears frightened, shows signs of physical abuse
-	Dropped off + collected very early/late

Some ways to end slavery could be:

-	Investigating and exposing cases of slavery
-	Protest for secure slavery laws
-	Support victims in their struggle
-	Empower communities and slaves to demand respect
-	Work to address slavery in the economy
